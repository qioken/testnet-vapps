## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: community and messaging
- **Category**: social

### Description
Problem it solves:
In today's digital world, social platforms are controlled by centralized entities that collect and monetize user data without transparent consent. Content moderation, identity, and reach are often influenced by opaque algorithms, leading to distrust and censorship concerns. Additionally, creators often struggle to monetize their content fairly.

What the vApp does:
Our vApp provides a decentralized social networking platform where users fully own their identity, data, and content. Built on blockchain, it enables censorship-resistant communication, transparent content moderation (via DAO voting), and on-chain identity management. Users can earn tokens for engagement, content creation, and moderation participation, promoting a fair and community-driven ecosystem.

### SL Integration  
We will integrate Soundness Layer (SL) to ensure the reliability, correctness, and transparency of our social vApp during both development and production stages. Specifically, we plan to utilize the following SL features:

Formal Verification Tools
We will use SL’s formal verification tools to mathematically prove the correctness of our smart contracts — especially those handling content moderation logic, token rewards distribution, and identity verification — to avoid critical bugs or exploits.

Runtime Monitoring
The SL’s runtime monitoring feature will help us detect unexpected behaviors during user interactions, enabling us to identify vulnerabilities in real-time and enhance the app’s resilience.

Decentralized Audit Layer
By integrating with SL’s decentralized audit network, we can crowdsource and incentivize ongoing verification of new smart contract updates or feature deployments, making our platform more trustworthy and transparent.

Proof Generation & Validation
For actions like content validation, reward claims, or DAO voting results, we will use SL’s zero-knowledge proof system to provide verifiable proof of correctness without revealing sensitive user data — protecting privacy while maintaining integrity.

In short, Soundness Layer will be critical for ensuring the security, transparency, and user trust in our decentralized social platform.
